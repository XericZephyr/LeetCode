## Math 
* Fraction to Recurring Decimal: Simple, but with many corner cases

## Array
* 4sum, not similar to 2sum, optimization by several well-designed conditions.
* 3sum, similar to 4sum, but really requires O(n^2) time complexity
* 3Sum Closest, Not hard, very similar to 3sum  


## Tree Related 

* Binary Tree Right Side View, Simple solution by level order traversal 
* Count Complete Tree Nodes: Cheating, but works 

* Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node, No idea the meaning of 'constant space'
* Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II, AC, but solution is wrong since not only use constant space


## List or Pointer 
* Rotate List: Just try to fool you by different corner case 
* Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II: Simple, just use two pointers 
* Partition List: Two Pointers, very simple
* Container With Most Water: This one is very simple. Just have problems to understand question. 

## Question 
* In level-order traversal or BFS, how does "constant space" count? 
    Does this mean the use of node queue is prohibited? 
* This is called O(N) ???? https://leetcode.com/discuss/74447/java-o-n-minimum-size-subarray-sum-using-two-pointers
