* Fraction to Recurring Decimal: Simple, but with many corner cases

* 4sum, not similar to 2sum, optimization by several well-designed conditions.
* 3sum, similar to 4sum, but really requires O(n^2) time complexity
* 3Sum Closest, Not hard, very similar to 3sum  

* Binary Tree Right Side View, Simple solution by level order traversal 

* Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node, No idea the meaning of 'constant space'


Question: 
* In level-order traversal or BFS, how does "constant space" count? 
    Does this mean the use of node queue is prohibited?
