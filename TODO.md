## Incomplete List for Optimization of Algorithm 

[ ] Repeated DNA Sequences, We can do one-pass O(N) algorithm. 
[ ] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, No idea. 
[ ] Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node, No idea the meaning of 'constant space'
[ ] Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II, AC, but solution is wrong since not only use constant space
[ ] Count Complete Tree Nodes: Cheating, but works 
[ ] Find the Duplicate Number: Could use Linked List Cycle II to solve it, very tricky.
[ ] H Index II: Corner case, do it again
